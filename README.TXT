This is a school project. It builds a hash table from an input text file and prints it to the 
standard output. Then it reads through a second input file and builds a binary search tree
of common words in both files and prints the tree in alphabetical order.

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
Download the zip file. Run the Tester.java file.
